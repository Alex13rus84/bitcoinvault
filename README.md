This example implementation of the Bitcoin Royale protocol is based on a fork of Bitcoin Core. Similarly, it is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

Bitcoin Royale is an open community project. Anyone in the community can make suggestions regarding modifications and offer a reference implementation. Miners and full nodes ultimately choose whether to accept these changes and upgrade.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing code modifications is critical before adopting any proposed codebase changes. You have the responsibility to test and verify that the code behaves according to the well accepted protocol. To assist with this process, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

Installing
----------

For build and installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). The file also contains the main differences in naming from Bitcoin Core, such as `broyaled` instead of `bitcoind`.

Fair Play
---------

Similar to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Royale is a decentralized community-driven project. The authors of this reference implemntation provide no guarantees to its completeness, accuracy or future roadmap. You may become a member of the community by working on your own reference implementation or participating as a contributor on this one.
